        Heading is basically to break up text into logical sections.
        Each and every page should only have one H1 heading, So only one primary heading.
        This is very important to keep in mind.
        This is not really mandatory, so it doesn't violate any html rules, if we have multiple H1s, but it is very good practice to always just have one of them.
        Now, about all the other ones, we can have of course, multiple of them.

          All modern websites and web applications are built using three
          <em>fundamental</em>
          technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
          web.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
          about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

        <p>
          HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
          <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup
          language that web developers use to structure and describe the content
          of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>

        <p>
          HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
          paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers
          understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>

        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The opening tag</li>
          <li>The closing tag</li>
          <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <!-- 
        ol stands for ordered list 
        li stands for list item
    -->

        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

        <p>
          There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of
          the web. Here are 5 of them:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
          <li>
            To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
            Worpress or Wix
          </li>
          <li>To build web applications</li>
          <li>To impress friends</li>
          <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
        </ul>

<!-- 
    Note: 
    1. So every HTML document always needs to start with the so-colled doctype and so this will let the browser know that we are actually using HTML in this file and all browsers will then know that they should use the HTML five specificationto render this html.
    2. Then we have the HTML element, which is always the parent element of both the head and of the body element
    3. So this structure is really always the same in all webpages, we alwasy need to have an HTML element with a head and with a body. 

    Note on Semantic HTML:
    1. Semantics means that certain elements have actually a meaning or a purpose attached to them
    2. So when we think about a certain HTML element, we should actually not think about what that element looks like as it's rendered on the page but instead, we should think about what that element actually means and what it stands for.
    3. Not all element in HTML are semantic.
